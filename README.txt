It is advisable to create links in the home directory pointing to the dotfiles inside the version controled folder.
This ensures that the files can be read in ~/ and are still managed and up to date.

As an example use 'ln -s ~/git/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc' to create link in the home directory pointing to the git folder file.
